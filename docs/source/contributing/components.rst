Components
==========

We distinguish two major components, the Orchestrator and the Backend.
Although they are independent, their versions must match a tested release as referenced in the :ref:`compatibility table <compatibility table>`.

You can deploy them in `Kubernetes`_ clusters using `Helm charts`_.
