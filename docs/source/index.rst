Substra is an open source federated learning (FL) software. It provides a flexible Python interface and a web app to run federated learning training at scale.

Substra's main usage is in production environments. It has already been deployed and used by hospitals and biotech companies (see the `MELLODDY <https://www.melloddy.eu/>`_ project for instance). Substra can also be used on a single machine on a virtually splitted dataset to perform FL simulations and debug code before launching experiments on a real network.

Substra was created by `Owkin <https://owkin.com/>`_ and is now hosted by the `Linux Foundation for AI and Data <https://lfaidata.foundation/>`_.

Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^


Substra has three user interfaces:
    * **Substra**: a low-level Python library (also called SDK). Substra is used to create datasets, algorithms and machine learning tasks on the platform.
    * **Substrafl**: a high-level federated learning Python library based on Substra. Substrafl is used to run complex federated learning experiments at scale.
    * A **web application** used to monitor experiments training and explore their results.



Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install substra and substrafl with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install substrafl

Substra is a dependency of Substrafl, so it will be automatically installed.
