Substra documentation
=====================

Substra is an open source federated learning (FL) software. It provides a flexible Python interface and a web app to run federated learning training at scale.

Substra's main usage is in production environments. It has already been deployed and used by hospitals and biotech companies (see the `MELLODDY <https://www.melloddy.eu/>`_ project for instance). Substra can also be used on a single machine on a virtually split dataset to perform FL simulations and debug code before launching experiments on a real network.

Substra was created by `Owkin <https://owkin.com/>`_ and is now hosted by the `Linux Foundation for AI and Data <https://lfaidata.foundation/>`_.

How does it work?

Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^


Substra has three user interfaces:
    * **Substra**: a low-level Python library (also called SDK). Substra is used to create datasets, functions and machine learning tasks on the platform.
    * **SubstraFL**: a high-level federated learning Python library based on Substra. SubstraFL is used to run complex federated learning experiments at scale.
    * A **web application** used to monitor experiments training and explore their results.



Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Client side**: Install Substra and SubstraFL python libraries with the following command: ``pip install substrafl``. Substra python library is a dependency of SubstraFL, so it will be automatically installed. More information on the installation :ref:`can be found here <substrafl_doc/substrafl_overview:Installation>`.

**Server side**: There are two options to deploy the server side of Substra (backend, frontend and orchestrator):

* :ref:`Local deployment <how-to/developing-substra/local-deployment:Local deployment>`: to deploy locally on a single one machine. Useful for quick tests and for development.
* :doc:`Production deployment <how-to/deploying-substra/index>`: for real deployments.

.. note::
   You can start doing local FL experiments with Substra by installing only the **client side**.
