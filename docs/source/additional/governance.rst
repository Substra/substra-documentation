Governance
==========

This document briefly describes "how we make decisions" in the Substra Project.

Overall
-------

This project is a Linux Foundation AI & Data (`LFAI <https://lfaidata.foundation/>`_) project.


In terms of "Governance models" `Gardler and Hanganu <http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/governancemodels>`_ the Substra project is a bazaar -
contributions are gladly welcomed from anyone.
The project is led by a single technical lead designated by `Owkin <https://owkin.com/>`_.
The technical lead has final say on decisions, but the technical lead is subject to being overruled or replaced by `Owkin <https://owkin.com/>`_.
Also, since the project is FLOSS, the project can be forked; this ability to fork also provides a check against despotism.
The technical lead's job is focus on doing what's best for this project, and the project's goal is to help the FLOSS community overall.

The technical lead has commit rights on the software, and administrative rights to the production site, and can add or remove those rights to others.
Those with code owners rights can accept changes (typically pull requests) submitted by others.
These changes include changes to the process and contribution requirements.

Process
-------

We generally use the GitHub issue tracker and pull requests for managing changes.
For details, including contribution requirements, see our Contributing Guide (ADD LINK).
Note that we emphasize two-person review for anything other than low-risk contributions.

Issues that we have determined are especially important, particularly if they will take a while, are added to the "next" milestone
(which identifies "what should be prioritized next").

We expect people to focus on improving the project, not attacking other
people. Please strive to "Be excellent to each other."
For more information, see our Code of Conduct(ADD LINK).
