How-to use new API tokens for login
===================================

This short guide explains how to manage API tokens in the web application, and use them in the Substra SDK.

.. admonition:: Why generate API tokens?

   The Substra SDK provides a way to log in using username and password (see `substra.Client <references/sdk.html#client>`_).
   
   It is safe, but should be used with caution:
   
   * It doesn't allow for a precise lifetime or separating concerns by creating one token per purpose.
   
   * It may surprise or limit you through its underlying automated session management.
   
   * It can encourage using cleartext passwords, which can end up shared in version control.
   
   For these reasons, it is possible for Substra node administrators (via `chart options <https://github.com/Substra/substra-backend/blob/main/charts/substra-backend/README.md#server-settings>`_) to disable "implicit login" and force users to generate tokens in the web app.
   
   Whatever the situation, you should use a mechanism to ensure credentials are kept out of view, for instance by reading secret files or environment variables at runtime (see :ref:`client configuration howto`).
   

.. warning::
   API tokens are node-specific: if your script connects to multiple nodes, generate a token for each of them.

Generating new API tokens
-------------------------

To do so you need to go to the API tokens management page on the web application following this link ``<your-org-name.domain>/manage_tokens``. 
You will see a list of your current tokens as well as an option to generate new ones. 

You can also navigate to the page using the user menu:

Clicking ``Generate new`` opens a menu allowing you to pick a name and an expiration date for
your new token.

Afterward your token will be shown only once. Do copy it somewhere safe before proceeding with your work.

Using API tokens
----------------

Pass tokens to the `substra.Client <references/sdk.html#client>`_ constructor:

.. code-block:: Python
    :caption: Example of client configuration in code

    client_1 = substra.Client(
        backend_type="remote",
        url="https://org-1.com",
        token="dad943c684f65633635f005b2522a6452d20",
    )

See :ref:`client configuration howto` for other options.

Deleting API tokens
-------------------

Tokens can be deleted using the web application. Be careful, token deletion is irreversible.

If you have scripts using a deleted token, they will no longer execute.
