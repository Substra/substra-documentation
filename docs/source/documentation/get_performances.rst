Performance monitoring in local mode
====================================

Performances of a compute plan can be retrieved
- with the get_performances(CP_KEY) function of the `SDK <api_reference.html#sdk-reference>`_
- on the Substra GUI when using the `deployed mode <debug.html#deployed-mode>`_.
However in the `local mode <debug.html#local-mode>`_, there is no GUI. This page explains how to use `MLFlow <https://mlflow.org/>`_ to perform live monitoring of the compute plan performances in `local mode <debug.html#local-mode>`_.

Performance monitoring using MLFlow
-----------------------------------

During a `compute plan <concepts.html#compute-plan>`_ in `local mode <debug.html#local-mode>`_, the performances of your `testtuples <concepts.html#test-tuple>`_ are saved in a :code:`performance.json` file as soon as the task is done. This json file is stored in your :code:`.../local_worker/live_performances/compute_plan_key` folder.

The python script below reads the json file and plot the `metrics <concepts.html#metric>`_ results in live into a `mlflow <https://mlflow.org/>`_ server, creating a plot for each `metric <concepts.html#metric>`_ and `testtuple <concepts.html#test-tuple>`_ in your `compute plan <concepts.html#compute-plan>`_.

To run it, update :code:`CP_KEY` on the script below, run the python script, and launch the :code:`mlflow ui` command in a dedicated terminal.
Your metric results appears and is updated in live at the given url in your terminal.

This script will automatically end if the :code:`performance.json` file as not been updated in the last minute. For some `compute plan <concepts.html#compute-plan>`_, this parameter should be changed regarding the necessary time to perform each round.
