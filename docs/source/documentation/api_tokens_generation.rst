How-to generate new API tokens for login
========================================

This short guide explains how to use the API tokens management page.

Generating new API tokens
-------------------------

To do so you need to go to the API tokens management page on the web application following this link ``<your-org-name.domain>/manage_tokens``. 
You will see a list of your current token as well as an option to generate a new one. 

Clicking on this button opens a menu allowing you to pick a name and an expiration date for
your new token. 

Afterward your token will be shown only once. Do copy it somewhere safe before proceeding with your work. 

Deleting API tokens
-------------------

Each token will have a delete button on the right-hand side. Do be careful, token deletion is irreversible.
If you have scripts using this deleted token, they will no longer execute.
