How to deploy the Orchestrator
******************************

This guide shows you how to deploy the Orchestrator component of Substra.

Prerequisites
=============

To deploy the Orchestrator you will need a fully configured Kubernetes cluster.
You will also need some tools: 

* `Helm <https://helm.sh/>`_
* `gRPCurl <https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl>`_

Preparing your Helm values
==========================

The orchestrator deployment is packaged using Helm.
You can find the complete description of values that can be used to configure the chart on `Artifact Hub <https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/substra/orchestrator>`_.

#. Add the Helm repository for Substra:

   .. code-block:: bash

      helm repo add substra https://substra.github.io/charts/

#. Create a Helm values file named ``orchestrator-values.yaml`` with the following content:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ingress:
        enabled: true
        hostname: HOSTNAME

   | Replace ``HOSTNAME`` with the hostname of your Orchestrator.
   | This will setup the ingress to make your Orchestrator accessible at the defined hostname.

#. Setup your :term:`Substra channels<Channel>`.
   In the ``orchestrator-values.yaml`` file, add the following content:
        
   .. code-block:: yaml

      channels:
        - name: CHANNEL-NAME
          organizations: [ORG-NAME, ...]

   | Replace ``CHANNEL-NAME`` with the name you want to give to your channel.
   | Replace ``ORG-NAME, ...`` with the names of the :term:`Organizations<Organization>` that you want to include in this channel.
   | If you want more than one channel you can add more items in the list.

Here you have created the configuration required to have a running orchestrator that can support a Substra network.
If you want you can jump directly to the section :ref:`deploy-orchestrator`.
You can also follow along the next sections to enhance the security of your orchestrator.

Setup TLS
=========

In a production environment, we recommend to enable TLS for your orchestrator.
For this, you will need to generate a few certificates.
Here we will generate them manually but you can also use automated tools for this task.
If you want to use automated tools we provide a certificate resource for `cert-manager <https://cert-manager.io/>`_.
The ``orchestrator.tls.createCertificates`` values should be a good place for you to get started.

The Orchestrator needs to handle SSL termination for this to work.
You may need to adapt your proxy configuration to let the traffic go through it.
For example if you use ``ingress-nginx`` you may want to read the `ssl passthrough <https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/tls/#ssl-passthrough>`_ chapter of their documentation.

To setup TLS, follow these steps:

#. Enable TLS, in the ``orchestrator-values.yaml`` file add the following content:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      orchestrator:
        tls:
          enabled: true

#. Generate a self-signed Certificate Authority:

   #. Create an openssl config file named ``example-openssl.cnf`` with the following content:

      .. code-block:: ini

         [ req ]
         default_bits		= 2048
         default_md		= sha256
         distinguished_name	= req_distinguished_name

         [ req_distinguished_name ]

         [ v3_ca ]
         basicConstraints = critical,CA:TRUE
         subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
         authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always
         keyUsage = cRLSign, keyCertSign

   #. Generate a private key for signing certificates:

      .. code-block:: bash

         openssl genrsa -out orchestrator-ca.key 2048

   #. Generate your Certificate Authority certificate:
        
      .. code-block:: bash

        openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -sha256 -key orchestrator-ca.key -extensions v3_ca -config example-openssl.cnf -subj "/CN=Orchestrator Root CA" -out orchestrator-ca.crt

#. Generate a certificate for the Orchestrator

   #. Generate a certificate signing request:

      .. code-block:: bash

         openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout orchestrator-tls.key -subj "/CN=HOSTNAME" -out orchestrator-cert.csr

      | Replace ``HOSTNAME`` with the hostname of your Orchestrator.
        This should be the same ``HOSTNAME`` as in the ingress configuration.
      
      This will generate a private key for the orchestrator and a certificate signing request.
      You should have two new files in your current directory ``orchestrator-tls.key`` and ``orchestrator-cert.csr``.

   #. Sign the request with the Certificate Authority key:

      .. code-block:: bash

         openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in orchestrator-cert.csr -CA orchestrator-ca.crt -CAkey orchestrator-ca.key -CAcreateserial -out orchestrator-tls.crt -sha256 -extfile <(printf "subjectAltName=DNS:HOSTNAME")

      | Replace ``HOSTNAME`` with the hostname of your Orchestrator.

      .. caution:: 
         We don't recommend having your certificate valid for a year, you should change this value based on your company policy.

   #. Delete the Certificate Signing Request:

      .. code-block:: bash

         rm orchestrator-cert.csr orchestrator-ca.srl

#. Create a Kubernetes ConfigMap for the CA certificate:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
      
      kubectl create configmap orchestrator-tls-cacert --from-file=ca.crt=orchestrator-ca.crt

#. Create a Kubernetes Secret for the orchestrator TLS key and certificate:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      kubectl create secret tls orchestrator-tls-server-pair --cert=orchestrator-tls.crt --key=orchestrator-tls.key

.. _deploy-orchestrator:

Deploy the Chart
================

To deploy the orchestrator in your Kubernetes cluster follow these steps:

#. Deploy the Orchestrator Helm chart:

   .. code-block:: bash

      helm install RELEASE-NAME substra/orchestrator --version VERSION --values orchestrator-values.yaml

   | Replace ``RELEASE-NAME`` with the name of your orchestrator release (it can be any arbitrary name).
   | Replace ``VERSION`` with the version of the orchestrator helm chart you want to deploy.
   
   This will create all the Kubernetes resources required for a functional Orchestrator in your Kubernetes cluster.

#. Validate that the deployment was successful:

   .. code-block:: bash

      grpcurl [--cacert orchestrator-ca.crt] HOSTNAME:443 list

   | Replace ``HOSTNAME`` with the hostname of your orchestrator.
   | Add the ``--cacert`` argument if you deployed your orchestrator with TLS.
        
   The output of this command should be the following:

   .. code-block::

      Failed to list services: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = OE0003: missing or invalid header 'mspid'

   This is expected because the Orchestrator server expects some gRPC headers to be present but we did not provide them.
   Even if it is an error, since this response is from the server it is sufficient to tell your setup is working.
