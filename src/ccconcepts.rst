All of the concepts mentioned below are assets (basically a set of files) which are associated with a unique identifier on the platform. Below is a global figure gathering all the assets and the links between each other.

    Objective
        * a test dataset, that is to say a data manager associated with several test data samples
        * a metrics script ([python implementation](https://github.com/SubstraFoundation/substra-tools/blob/master/docs/api.md#metrics)).
        It mainly aims at standardizing the evaluation process of ML models. Since Substra focuses on supervised learning, each models trained on Substra has to be linked to an objective for evaluation.
