Federated Analytics on the diabetes dataset
===========================================

This example demonstrates how to use the flexibility of the SubstraFL library and the base class
ComputePlanBuilder to do Federated Analytics. It reproduces the `diabetes example <https://docs.substra.org/en/stable/auto_examples/diabetes_example/run_diabetes.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-diabetes-example-run-diabetes-py>`__
of the Substra SDK example section using SubstraFL.
If you are new to SubstraFL, we recommend to start by the `MNIST Example <https://docs.substra.org/en/stable/substrafl_doc/examples/get_started/run_mnist_torch.html#sphx-glr-substrafl-doc-examples-get-started-run-mnist-torch-py>`__
to learn how to use the library in the simplest configuration first.

We use the **Diabetes dataset** available from the `Scikit-Learn dataset module <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#diabetes-dataset>`__.
This dataset contains medical information such as Age, Sex or Blood pressure.
The goal of this example is to compute some analytics such as Age mean, Blood pressure standard deviation or Sex percentage.

We simulate having two different data organizations, and a third organization which wants to compute aggregated analytics
without having access to the raw data. The example here runs everything locally; however there is only one parameter to
change to run it on a real network.

**Caution:**
 This example is provided as an illustrative example only. In real life, you should be careful not to
 accidentally leak private information when doing Federated Analytics. For example if a column contains very similar values,
 sharing its mean and its standard deviation is functionally equivalent to sharing the content of the column.
 It is **strongly recommended** to consider what are the potential security risks in your use case, and to act accordingly.
 It is possible to use other privacy-preserving techniques, such as
 `Differential Privacy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy>`_, in addition to Substra.
 Because the focus of this example is Substra capabilities and for the sake of simplicity, such safeguards are not implemented here.


To run this example, you have two options:

- **Recommended option**: use a hosted Jupyter notebook. With this option you don't have to install anything, just run the notebook.
  To access the hosted notebook, scroll down at the bottom of this page and click on the **Launch Binder** button.
- **Run the example locally**. To do that you need to download and unzip the assets needed to run it in the same
  directory as used this example.

   .. only:: builder_html or readthedocs

        :download:`assets required to run this example <../../../../../tmp/diabetes_substrafl_assets.zip>`

  Please ensure to have all the libraries installed. A *requirements.txt* file is included in the zip file, where you can run the command ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install them.

# %%
# Instantiating the Substra clients
# =================================
#
# We work with three different organizations.
# Two organizations provide data, and a third one performs Federated Analytics to compute aggregated statistics without
# having access to the raw datasets.
#
# This example runs in local mode, simulating a federated learning experiment.
#
# In the following code cell, we define the different organizations needed for our FL experiment.

# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_path = 'static/example_thumbnail/diabetes.png'

from substra import Client

# Choose the subprocess mode to locally simulate the FL process
N_CLIENTS = 3
client_0 = Client(client_name="org-1")

# Create a dictionary to easily access each client from its human-friendly id

    client_0.organization_info().organization_id: client_0,
    client_1.organization_info().organization_id: client_1,
    client_2.organization_info().organization_id: client_2,

# Store organization IDs
ORGS_ID = list(clients)

# The provider of the functions for computing analytics is defined as the first organization.
ANALYTICS_PROVIDER_ORG_ID = ORGS_ID[0]
# Data providers orgs are the two last organizations.
DATA_PROVIDER_ORGS_ID = ORGS_ID[1:]

# %%
# Prepare the data
# ----------------
#
# The function ``setup_diabetes`` downloads if needed the *diabetes* dataset, and split it in two to simulate a
# federated setup. Each data organization has access to a chunk of the dataset.

# Registering data samples and dataset
# ------------------------------------
#
# Every asset will be created in respect to predefined specifications previously imported from
# ``substra.sdk.schemas``. To register assets, :ref:`documentation/api_reference:Schemas`
# are first instantiated and the specs are then registered, which generate the real assets.
#
# Permissions are defined when registering assets. In a nutshell:
#
# - Data cannot be seen once it's registered on the platform.
# - Metadata are visible by all the users of a network.
# - Permissions allow you to execute a function on a certain dataset.
#
# Next, we need to define the asset directory. You should have already downloaded the assets folder as stated above.
#
# A dataset represents the data in Substra. It contains some metadata and an *opener*, a script used to load the
# data from files into memory. You can find more details about datasets
# in the :ref:`API reference<documentation/references/sdk_schemas:DatasetSpec>`.

# %%
# The flexibility of the ComputePlanBuilder class
# ===============================================
#
# This example aims at explaining how to use the :ref:`substrafl_doc/api/compute_plan_builder:Compute Plan Builder`
# class, and how to use the full power of the flexibility it provides.
#
# Before starting, we need to have in mind that a federated computation can be represented as a graph of tasks.
# Some of these tasks need data to be executed (training tasks) and others are here to aggregate local results
# (aggregation tasks).
#
# Substra does not store an explicit definition of this graph; instead, it gives the user full flexibility to define
# the compute plan (or computation graph) they need, by linking a task to its parents.
#
# To create this graph of computations, SubstraFL provides the ``Node`` abstraction. A ``Node``
# assigns to an organization (aka a Client) tasks of a given type. The type of the ``Node`` depends on the type of tasks
# we want to run on this organization (training or aggregation tasks).
#
# An organization (aka Client) without data can host an
# :ref:`Aggregation node<substrafl_doc/api/nodes:AggregationNode>`.
# We will use the :ref:`Aggregation node<substrafl_doc/api/nodes:AggregationNode>` object to compute the aggregated
# analytics.
#
# An organization (aka a Client) containing the data samples can host a
# :ref:`Train data node<substrafl_doc/api/nodes:TrainDataNode>`.
# Each node will only have access data from the organization hosting it.
# These data samples must be instantiated with the right permissions to be processed by the given Client.

from substrafl.nodes import TrainDataNode
from substrafl.nodes import AggregationNode


aggregation_node = AggregationNode(ANALYTICS_PROVIDER_ORG_ID)

train_data_nodes = [
    TrainDataNode(
        organization_id=org_id,
        data_manager_key=dataset_keys[org_id],
        data_sample_keys=[datasample_keys[org_id]],
    )
    for org_id in DATA_PROVIDER_ORGS_ID
]

# %%
# The :ref:`substrafl_doc/api/compute_plan_builder:Compute Plan Builder` is an abstract class that asks the user to
# implement only three methods:
#
# - ``build_compute_plan(...)``
# - ``load_local_state(...)``
# - ``save_local_state(...)``
#
# The ``build_compute_plan`` method is essential to create the graph of the compute plan that will be executed on
# Substra. Using the different ``Nodes`` we created, we will update their states by applying user defined methods.
#
# These methods are passed as argument to the ``Node`` using its ``update_state`` method.

# Now that we saw the implementation of the custom ``Analytics`` class, we can add details to some of the previously

# This succession of ``next_state`` passed to a new ``node.update_state`` is how Substra build the graph of the
# compute plan.
#
# The ``load_local_state`` and ``save_local_state`` are two methods used at each new iteration on a Node, in order to
# retrieve the previous local state that have not been shared with the other ``Nodes``.
#
# For instance, after updating a :ref:`Train data node<substrafl_doc/api/nodes:TrainDataNode>` using its
# ``update_state`` method, we will have access to its next local state, that we will pass as argument to the
# next ``update_state`` we will apply on this :ref:`Train data node<substrafl_doc/api/nodes:TrainDataNode>`.
#
# To summarize, a :ref:`substrafl_doc/api/compute_plan_builder:Compute Plan Builder` is composed of several decorated
# user defined functions, that can need some data (decorated with ``@remote_data``) or not (decorated with ``@remote``).
#
# See :ref:`substrafl_doc/api/remote:Decorator` for more information on these decorators.
#
# These user defined functions will be used to create the graph of the compute plan through the ``build_compute_plan``
# method and the ``update_state`` method of the different ``Nodes``.
#
# The local state obtained after updating a :ref:`Train data node<substrafl_doc/api/nodes:TrainDataNode>` needs the
# methods ``save_local_state`` and ``load_local_state``  to retrieve the state where the Node was at the end of
# the last update.

# %%
# Running the experiment
# ======================
#
# As a last step before launching our experiment, we need to specify the third parties dependencies required to run it.
# The :ref:`substrafl_doc/api/dependency:Dependency` object is instantiated in order to install the right libraries in
# the Python environment of each organization.
#
# We now have all the necessary objects to launch our experiment. Please see a summary below of all the objects we created so far:
#
# - A :ref:`documentation/references/sdk:Client` to add or retrieve the assets of our experiment, using their keys to
#   identify them.
# - An :ref:`Torch algorithm<substrafl_doc/api/algorithms:Torch Algorithms>` to define the training parameters *(optimizer, train
#   function, predict function, etc...)*.
# - A :ref:`Federated Strategy<substrafl_doc/api/strategies:Strategies>`, to specify what compute plan we want to execute.
# - :ref:`Train data nodes<substrafl_doc/api/nodes:TrainDataNode>` to indicate on which data to train.
# - An :ref:`substrafl_doc/api/evaluation_strategy:Evaluation Strategy`, to define where and at which frequency we
#   evaluate the model. Here this does not apply to our experiment. We set it to None.
# - An :ref:`substrafl_doc/api/nodes:AggregationNode`, to specify the organization on which the aggregation operation
#   will be computed.
# - An **experiment folder** to save a summary of the operation made.
# - The :ref:`substrafl_doc/api/dependency:Dependency` to define the libraries on which the experiment needs to run.
