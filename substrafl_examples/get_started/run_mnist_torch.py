Using Torch FedAvg on MNIST dataset
===================================

This example illustrates the basic usage of SubstraFL and proposes Federated Learning using the Federated Averaging strategy
on the `MNIST Dataset of handwritten digits <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>`__ using PyTorch.
In this example, we work on 28x28 pixel sized grayscale images. This is a classification problem
aiming to recognize the number written on each image.

SubstraFL can be used with any machine learning framework (PyTorch, Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, etc).

However a specific interface has been developed for PyTorch which makes writing PyTorch code simpler than with other frameworks. This example here uses the specific PyTorch interface.

This example does not use a deployed platform of Substra and runs in local mode.

To run this example, you have two options:

- **Recommended option**: use a hosted Jupyter notebook. With this option you don't have to install anything, just run the notebook.
  To access the hosted notebook, scroll down at the bottom of this page and click on the **Launch Binder** button.
- **Run the example locally**. To do that you need to download and unzip the assets needed to run it in the same
  directory as used this example.

   .. only:: builder_html or readthedocs

      :download:`assets required to run this example <../../../../../tmp/torch_fedavg_assets.zip>`

  * Please ensure to have all the libraries installed. A *requirements.txt* file is included in the zip file, where you can run the command ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install them.
  * **Substra** and **SubstraFL** should already be installed. If not follow the instructions described here: :ref:`substrafl_doc/substrafl_overview:Installation`.

# %%
# Setup
# *****
#
# This example runs with three organizations. Two organizations provide datasets, while a third
# one provides the algorithm.
#
# In the following code cell, we define the different organizations needed for our FL experiment.


from substra import Client

N_CLIENTS = 3

client_0 = Client(client_name="org-1")
client_1 = Client(client_name="org-2")
client_2 = Client(client_name="org-3")

# %%
# Every computation will run in ``subprocess`` mode, where everything runs locally in Python
# subprocesses.
# Other backend_types are:
#
# - ``docker`` mode where computations run locally in docker containers
# - ``remote`` mode where computations run remotely (you need to have a deployed platform for that)
#
# To run in remote mode, use the following syntax:
#
# ``client_remote = Client(url="MY_BACKEND_URL")``
# ``client_remote.login(username="my-username", password="my-password")``


# Create a dictionary to easily access each client from its human-friendly id
clients = {
    client_0.organization_info().organization_id: client_0,
    client_1.organization_info().organization_id: client_1,
    client_2.organization_info().organization_id: client_2,
}

# Store organization IDs
ORGS_ID = list(clients)
ALGO_ORG_ID = ORGS_ID[0]  # Algo provider is defined as the first organization.
DATA_PROVIDER_ORGS_ID = ORGS_ID[1:]  # Data providers orgs are the two last organizations.

# Data and metrics
# ****************

# %%
# Data preparation
# ================
#
# This section downloads (if needed) the **MNIST dataset** using the `torchvision library
# <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html>`__.
# It extracts the images from the raw files and locally creates a folder for each
# organization.
#
# Each organization will have access to half the training data and half the test data (which
# corresponds to **30,000**
# images for training and **5,000** for testing each).

# %%
# Dataset registration
# ====================
#
# A :ref:`documentation/concepts:Dataset` is composed of an **opener**, which is a Python script that can load
# the data from the files in memory and a description markdown file.
# The :ref:`documentation/concepts:Dataset` object itself does not contain the data. The proper asset that contains the
# data is the **datasample asset**.
#
# A **datasample** contains a local path to the data. A datasample can be linked to a dataset in order to add data to a
# dataset.
#
# Data privacy is a key concept for Federated Learning experiments. That is why we set
# :ref:`documentation/concepts:Permissions` for :ref:`documentation/concepts:Assets` to determine how each organization
# can access a specific asset.
# You can read more about permissions in the :ref:`User Guide<documentation/concepts:Permissions>`.
#
# Note that metadata such as the assets' creation date and the asset owner are visible to all the organizations of a
# network.

#
# To add a metric, you need to define a function that computes and returns a performance
# from the datasamples (as returned by the opener) and the predictions_path (to be loaded within the function).
#
# When using a Torch SubstraFL algorithm, the predictions are saved in the ``predict`` function in numpy format
# so that you can simply load them using ``np.load``.

# Federated Learning strategies

# updates.

# - An :ref:`substrafl_doc/api/evaluation_strategy:Evaluation Strategy`, to define where and at which frequency we

# - An :ref:`substrafl_doc/api/nodes:AggregationNode`, to specify the organization on which the aggregation operation
#   will be computed.
# - The **number of rounds**, a round being defined by a local training step followed by an aggregation operation.
# - An **experiment folder** to save a summary of the operation made.
